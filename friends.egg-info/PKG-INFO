        # Azure Databricks CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps
        
        Throughout the Development lifecycle of an application, [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) is a [DevOps](/en/tag/devops) process enforcing automation in building, testing and desploying applications. Development and Operation teams can leverage the advantages of CI/CD to deliver more frequently and reliably releases in a timly manner while ensuring quick iterations.
        
        CI/CD is becoming a necessary process for data engineering and data science teams to deliver valuable data projects and increase confidence in the quality of the outcomes. With [Azure Databricks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/databricks/) you can use solutions like Azure DevOps, Gitlabs, Github Actions or Jenkins to build a CI/CD pipeline to reliably build, test, and deploy your notebooks and libraries.
        
        In this article we will guide you step by step to create an effective CI/CD pipeline using Azure Devop to deploy a simple notebook and a library to Azure Databricks. We will show how to manage sensitive data during the process using [Azure Keyvault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/) and how to secure the communication between Azure Databricks and our object storage.
        
        ## Description of our pipeline
        
        Our stack:
        
        - Azure Databricks
        - Azure Devops: to build, test and deploy our artifacts (notebook and library) to Azure Databricks
        - Azure Data Lake Storage Service: To store our dataset that will be consumed by Azure Databricks
        - Azure Key vault: to store sensitive data
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        1. An Azure Account and an active subscription. You can create a free account [here]().
        2. Azure Devops Organization that will hold a project for our repository and our pipeline assets
        
        Clone the repository
        
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/bngom/azure-databricks-cicd.git && cd azure-databricks-cicd
        ```
        
        Create a python environment and install dependencies
        
        ```sh
        python -m venv dbcicd
        ```
        
        Activate the virtual environment
        
        ```sh
        source dbcicd/bin/activate
        ```
        
        Install requirements
        
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        Run lint test
        
        ```sh
        python -m pip install flake8
        flake8 ./test/ ./src/
        ```
        
        Run unit test:
        
        ```sh
        python -m test
        ```
        
        ## Setting up Azure CLI
        
        You can use [Azure Cloud Shell](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/cloud-shell/) from the directry you would like to deploy your resources. Or ou can install [install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux?pivots=apt).
        
        ```sh
        curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
        ```
        
        Configure Azure CLI, your default browser will prompt for you to enter your credentials. This will connect you to your default tenant.
        
        ```sh
        az login
        ```
        
        Get details about your Azure account.
        
        ```sh
        az account show
        ```
        
        ![](./assets/account-info.png)
        
        You can now if you wish connect to another directory by specifying the `tenant_id`.
        
        ```sh
        az login --tenant <TENANT_ID>
        ```
        
        ### Prerequisites for Azure
        
        - Resource Group: In our selected directory let us create a resource Group
        
        ```sh
        rg_name="databricks-rg"
        location="francecentral"
        az group create --name $rg_name --location $location
        ```
        
        - Test the validity of our Azure Resource Management (ARM) Template: You will find in the folder `./template` a model file `dbx.parameter.json` that describe resources we want to deploy on Azure and a parameter file `dbx.parameter.json`.
        
        > For our parameter file `dbx.parameter.json` we choose to not store in plain text sensitive information such as the tenant_id. We use a templating form like `<tenantId>`. This value will be overridden in Azure DevOps during the build pipeline. But to test the validity of our ARM templase, make sure to replace all values `<>` with good values. This include: `<storageAccountName>`, `<containerName>`, `<workspaceName>`, `<keyvaultName>`, `<tenantId>`. E.g for `<storageAccountName>` you can replace it by `dbxbnsa`...
        >
        > ![](./assets/param-template.PNG)
        >
        > to get your `objectId` run `az ad signed-in-user show | jq '.objectId'`
        
        With the command below, we test the deployment of our ARM template against the resource group using the `what-if` option. This will only validate your template. The deployment will be done during the build phase in azure devops.
        
        ```sh
        cd template
        az deployment group what-if --name TestDeployment --resource-group $rg_name --template-file dbx.template.json --parameters @dbx.parameters.json
        ```
        
        ## Setting up Azure DevOps
        
        In this section we will create a Azure DevOps Organization, create a project and upload our repository. We will also set up an *Azure Resource Manager connection* in Azure Devops to authorize communication between Azure DevOps and the Azure Resource Manager.
        
        ### Configure the DevOps environment
        
        1. Go to [dev.azure.com](dev.azure.com)
        2. [Create an Azure DevOps Organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops)
        
        - Click on *New organization*, then click on *Continue*
        
        ![](./assets/neworg.png)
        
        - Set the name of your Azure DevOps organization, then click on *Continue*.
        
        ![](./assets/dbx-cicd-org.png)
        
        3. [Create a Project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page) in your Azure DevOps Organisation
        
        - In your new organization, set your project name then click on *Create project*
        
        ![](./assets/new-project.png)
        
        4. Import a repository
        
        - Click on your new project
        
        ![](./assets/new-repo.png)
        
        - Click on *Repo*
        
        ![](./assets/new-repo-1.PNG)
        
        - then on *Import repository*: Use the url `https://github.com/bngom/azure-databricks-cicd.git`
        
        ![](./assets/import-repo.png)
        
        5. Set an Azure Resource Manager connection
        
        - Project Settings > Pipeline : Service connections > Create service connections
        
        ![](./assets/new-service-connections.png)
        
        - Select Azure Resource Manager
        
        ![](./assets/new-service-connections-1.png)
        
        - Select *Service principal (automatique)*
        
        ![](./assets/new-service-connections-2.png)
        
        - Select your subscription and the resource group `databricks-rg` created previously and save.
        
        ![](./assets/new-service-connections-3.png)
        
        ### Create a Build Pipeline
        
        We are all set to create a Build pipeline. This operation will generate artifacts to be consumed in our release pipeline.
        
        - Pipelines > Pipelines: CLick on *New pipeline*
        
        ![](./assets/new-pipeline.PNG)
        
        - Select *Azure GIt Repo*
        
        ![](./assets/new-pipeline-1.PNG)
        
        - Select your repository
        
        ![](./assets/new-pipeline-2.PNG)
        
        - Select *Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file* and select the `azure-pielines.yml` file from your repository.
        
        ![](./assets/new-pipeline-3.PNG)
        
        ![](./assets/new-pipeline-4.PNG)
        
        The `azure-pipelines.yml` file in your repository is automatically detected. The build pipeline is composed of steps that include tasks and scripts to be executed againts different python version. The pipeline will first install all requirements and run unit test. If succeeded it will publish an ARM template and a notebook artifacts, then build a python library and publish it. There is also a task involving test coverage evaluation.
        
        ![](./assets/new-pipeline-5.PNG)
        
        - Now you can run your build pipeline. Click on *Run*
        
        The build pipeline executed successfully and artifacts are generated and ready to be consumed in a release pipeline.
        
        ![](./assets/build-pipeline-success.png)
        
        ![](./assets/summary-build.png)
        
        Before Creating a release pipeline let us do some configuration in azure devops. For security purpose, we have dummy variales in our template parameter file `dbx.parameters.json`. We will use a *variable group* and use it to overwrite our dummy variables during release process.
        
        Create Variable Group:
        
        - Pipeline > Library > +Variable Group
        
        ![](./assets/new-variable-grp.png)
        
        - Create the following variables, and save
        
        ![](./assets/variable-grp.png)
        
        ### Create a Release Pipeline
        
        ***PHASE 1***
        
        In this section, we will create a release to deploy resources (Databricks workspace, KeyVault, Storage Account and Container for blob storage) on Microsoft Azure.
        
        - Pipelines > Release: New release pipeline
        
        ![](./assets/new-release-0.png)
        
        - On the right blade, For *select a template* click on *Empty Job*
        
        ![](./assets/empty-job.png)
        
        - Update the Stage name to *Development*
        
        ![](./assets/stage-dev.png)
        
        - Click on *Add artifacts* and Select the source build pipeline `demo-cicd`. The click on *Add*
        
        ![](./assets/add-artifacts.png)
        
        - Click on *Variable* and link our Variable Group to stage *Development*
        
        ![](./assets/link-variable-grp.png)
        
        ![](./assets/link-variable-grp-2.png)
        
        - Now, click on  *Tasks*:
        
          - Check the Agent job set up: make sure the Agent Specification is set to `ubuntu-20.04`
          - Clic on `+` sign near Agent job
        
            ![](./assets/plus-task.png)
        
          - Add ARM Resource Deployment and configure it accordingly giving the template and parameter files. And overwriting the variables:
          ![](./assets/arm-template-deployment-0.png)
            - `Deployment scope`: Resource Group
            - `Resource manager connection`: Select your Azure Resource manager connection and click on *Authorize*
            - `Subscription`: Select your subscription
            - `Action`: Create or update resource group
            - `Resource group`: Select the resource group created previously or use the variable $(rg_name)
            - `Location`: idem, or $(location)
            - `Template`: Click on `more` and select `dbx.template.json` in the template artifacts
            - `Template parameters`: select `dbx.parameters.json`in the template artifacts
            - `Override template parameter`: Update tha values of the parameters with the variables we created in our variable group.
        
               ![](./assets/template-parameters.png)
        
              Or you can past the folowing lines of code
        
              ```sh
              -objectId $(object_id) -keyvaultName $(keyvault) -location $(location) -storageAccountName $(sa_name) -containerName $(container) -workspaceName $(workspace) -workspaceLocation $(location) -tier "premium" -sku "Standard" -tenant $(tenant_id) -networkAcls {"defaultAction":"Allow","bypass":"AzureServices","virtualNetworkRules":[],"ipRules":[]}
              ```
        
            - Deployment mode: Incremental
            - Now, save your configuration
        
              ![](./assets/arm-template-deployment.png)
        
        We are ready now to create a first release
        
        - Click on the button: *Create release*
        
        ![](./assets/create-release-btn.png)
        
        - Stages for a trigger change from automated to manual: select *Development*
        
        ![](./assets/new-release.png)
        
        - Click on *create*
        - Go to Pipelines > Release
        - Select our release pipeline
        
        ![](./assets/select-release.png)
        
        - Click on the newly created release and click on `Deploy`
        
        ![](./assets/deploy-release.png)
        
        Our pipeline executed successfully
        
        ![](./assets/release-pipeline-success.png)
        
        And our resources are deployed in Azure. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and check the content of our resource group. You will find in the resource group a keyvault, a databricks workspace, a storage account and a container in the storage account.
        
        ![](./assets/check-az-resources.png)
        
        ***PHASE 2***
        
        We will complete the deployment of our release pipeline but for security concerns, let us enforce the security between Databricks and other azure resources.
        
        **Generate Databricks Token**
        
        Log into the Databricks Workspace and under User settings (icon in the top right corner) and select “Generate New Token”. Choose a descriptive name and copy the token to a notebook or clipboard. The token is displayed just once.
        
        ![](./assets/dbx-token.png)
        
        Make sure that for Git integration, the git provider is set to `Azure DevOps Services`
        
        ![](./assets/git-integration.png)
        
        The following command show you how to copy the new token and save it into your keyvault.
        > At the same time we will save the URI of our Databricks service, you can find this one in Azure portal.
        >
        > ![](./assets/dbx-service.png)
        
        ```sh
        dbxtoken="your databricks token"
        keyvault_name="your keyvault name"
        dbxuri="https://adb-<workspace-id>.<random-number>.azuredatabricks.net"
        az keyvault secret set --vault-name $keyvault_name --name "dbxtoken" --value $dbxtoken
        az keyvault secret set --vault-name $keyvault_name --name "dbxuri" --value $dbxuri
        ```
        
        **Key vault sas token**
        
        Generate a shared access signature token for the storage account. This will secure the communication between Azure Databricks and the object storage.
        
        ```sh
        sa_name="your storage account"
        end=`date -u -d "10080 minutes" '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ'`
        az storage account generate-sas \
          --permissions lruwap \
          --account-name $sa_name \
          --services b \
          --resource-types sco \
          --expiry $end \
          -o json
        ```
        
        Your SAS Token is generated, copy it with the storage account and the container name the key vault.
        
        ```sh
        sastoken="key vault sas token"
        container="your container"
        az keyvault secret set --vault-name $keyvault_name --name "storagerw" --value $sastoken
        az keyvault secret set --vault-name $keyvault_name --name "storageaccount" --value $sa_name
        az keyvault secret set --vault-name $keyvault_name --name "container" --value $container
        ```
        
        List your secrets
        
        ```sh
        az keyvault secret list --vault-name $keyvault_name --output table
        ```
        
        **Configure Databricks CLI**
        
        ```sh
        pip install databricks-cli
        ```
        
        Configure your cli to interact with databricks. You will need to enter the uri and the token generated
        
        ```sh
        databricks configure --token
        # https://adb-<workspace-id>.<random-number>.azuredatabricks.net
        # your-databricks-token
        
        ```
        
        **Create a cluster in databricks**
        
        Once the connection is established, we can create a cluster in databricks
        
        ```sh
        rm -f create-cluster.json
        cat <<EOF >> create-cluster.json
        {
          "num_workers": null,
          "autoscale": {
              "min_workers": 2,
              "max_workers": 8
          },
          "cluster_name": "dbx-cluster",
          "spark_version": "8.2.x-scala2.12",
          "spark_conf": {},
          "azure_attributes": {
              "first_on_demand": 1,
              "availability": "ON_DEMAND_AZURE",
              "spot_bid_max_price": -1
          },
          "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2",
          "ssh_public_keys": [],
          "custom_tags": {},
          "spark_env_vars": {
              "PYSPARK_PYTHON": "/databricks/python3/bin/python3"
          },
          "autotermination_minutes": 30,
          "cluster_source": "UI",
          "init_scripts": []
        }
        EOF
        
        databricks clusters create --json-file create-cluster.json
        ```
        
        **Create an Azure Key Vault-backed secret scope in Databricks**
        
        Get the resource ID and the DNS name from your key vault properties and create a secret scope in Azure Databricks.
        
        ```sh
        keyvault_name="dbx-bn-keyvault"
        vaultUri=$(az keyvault show --name $keyvault_name | jq '.properties.vaultUri')
        vaultId=$(az keyvault show --name $keyvault_name | jq '.id')
        databricks secrets create-scope --scope demo --scope-backend-type AZURE_KEYVAULT --resource-id $vaultId --dns-name $vaultUri
        # List the scope(s)
        databricks secrets list-scopes
        ```
        
        Oups! The above command raised and error `Scope with Azure KeyVault must have userAADToken defined!`. It seems to be an bug. But no worries, you can still create the scope from the databricks workspace using the following url `https://adb-<workspace-id>.<random-number>.azuredatabricks.net/?o=<workspace-id>#secrets/createScope`.
        
        ![](./assets/create-scope.png)
        
        And you can test if your secrets are accessible from your workspace.

        Great! Let's test if we can from our workspace mount the container in our storage account and read a dataset we uploaded inside.
        
        ```sh
        az storage blob upload \
          --name friends.csv \
          --account-name $sa_name \
          --container-name $container \
          --file ./data/friends.csv
        ```
        
        Upload the following notebook into your workspace and test if you can securely access the dataset uploaded in your storage account container.
        
        ```sh
        cat <<EOF >> demo.py
        # Databricks notebook source
        dbutils.secrets.listScopes()
        
        # COMMAND ----------
        
        dbutils.secrets.list("demo")
        
        # COMMAND ----------
        
        print(dbutils.secrets.get(scope="demo", key="storagerw"))
        
        # COMMAND ----------
        
        # Unmount directory if previously mounted.
        MOUNTPOINT = "/mnt/commonfiles"
        if MOUNTPOINT in [mnt.mountPoint for mnt in dbutils.fs.mounts()]:
          dbutils.fs.unmount(MOUNTPOINT)
        
        # Add the Storage Account, Container, and reference the secret to pass the SAS Token
        STORAGE_ACCOUNT = dbutils.secrets.get(scope="demo", key="storageaccount")
        CONTAINER = dbutils.secrets.get(scope="demo", key="container")
        SASTOKEN = dbutils.secrets.get(scope="demo", key="storagerw")
        SOURCE = "wasbs://{container}@{storage_acct}.blob.core.windows.net/".format(container=CONTAINER, storage_acct=STORAGE_ACCOUNT)
        URI = "fs.azure.sas.{container}.{storage_acct}.blob.core.windows.net".format(container=CONTAINER, storage_acct=STORAGE_ACCOUNT)
        
        try:
          dbutils.fs.mount(
            source=SOURCE,
            mount_point=MOUNTPOINT,
            extra_configs={URI:SASTOKEN})
        except Exception as e:
          if "Directory already mounted" in str(e):
            pass # Ignore error if already mounted.
          else:
            raise e
        
        display(dbutils.fs.ls(MOUNTPOINT))
        
        # COMMAND ----------
        
        friendsDF = (spark.read
                      .option("header", True)
                      .option("inferSchema", True)
                      .csv(MOUNTPOINT + "/friends.csv"))
        
        display(friendsDF)
        EOF
        ```
        
        We can successfully access data stored in the storage account's container.
        
        ![](./assets/test-sa.png).
        
        **Release Pipeline: continue**
        
        We can now finis the configuration of our release pipeline. Let's first create a new variable group and link it with our azure keyvault.
        
        - Go to Pipelines > Library
        - Click on *Variables* and add a new variable group
        - Toggle `Link secrets from an Azure vault as variables`
        - Select your subscription
        - Select the key vault name
        - Add variables from the keyvault
        
        ![](./assets/dbx-variable-grp-secrets.png)
        
        Add a third variable group to save the name of our Notebook and the folder where we will deploy it.
        
        ![](./assets/link-variable-grp-notebook.png)
        
        Edit our release pipeline and link the variable groups we just created to `Release` scope
        
        - Go to Pipelines > Release: Select our pipeline and Edit the pipeline.
        - Link the variable groups to Release scope
        
        ![](./assets/link-azure-secrets.png)
        
        ![](./assets/link-variable-grp-all.png)
        
        Now we are ready to update our tasks
        
        - Go to Tasks
        - Add `UsePythonVersion` task. **Put it above the `AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment`**
        
          ![](./assets/use-python-task.png)
        
        - After `AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment` task add a Bash script
        
        ![](./assets/dbx-cli-task.png)
        
        - Add a bash task; Rename it to `Databricks configure` and add the following code in the Inline Script.
        
        ```sh
        databricks configure --token <<EOF
        https://adb-<workspace-id>.<random-number>.azuredatabricks.net
        $(dbxtoken)
        EOF
        ```
        
        - Add a Bash task; Rename it to `Import notebook into databricks` and add the following code in the Inline Script.
        
        ```sh
        databricks workspace mkdirs /$(folder)
        databricks workspace import --language PYTHON --format SOURCE --overwrite _demo-cicd/notebook/$(notebook-name)-$(Build.SourceVersion).py /$(folder)/$(notebook-name)-$(Build.SourceVersion).py
        ```
        
        - Add a Bash task; Rename it to `Import library into databricks` and add the following code in the Inline Script.
        
        ```sh
        # create a new directory
        databricks fs mkdirs dbfs:/dbx-library
        # Import the module
        # databricks fs rm _demo-cicd//wheel/friends-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
        databricks fs cp _demo-cicd/wheel/friends-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl dbfs:/dbx-library/
        ```
        
        - Add a Bash task; Rename it to `Install Library and attach it to the cluster` and add the following code in the Inline Script.
        
        ```sh
        cluster_id=$(databricks clusters list --output JSON | jq '[ .clusters[] | { name: .cluster_name, id: .cluster_id, state: .state } ]' | jq '.[] | select(.name=="dbx-cluster")' | jq -r '.id')
        # The above query have to be adapted if there is more than one cluster with the same name. They will be in different states.
        
        echo "Cluster id: $cluster_id"
        
        # Install library
        databricks libraries install --cluster-id $cluster_id --whl dbfs:/dbx-library/friends-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        
        Our tasks will end up to look like this:
        
        ![](./assets/final-tasks.png)
        
        - Save our tasks and Create a release pipeline.
        - Make sure your Databricks cluster is in `RUNNING` state
        - Then, Deploy the release
        
        ![](./assets/release-pipeline-success-2.png)
        
        Our Notebook is deployed.
        
        ![](./assets/notebook-deployed.png)
        
        Our library is imported and installed on our cluster.
        
        ![](./assets/library-installed.png)
        
        ![](./assets/pip-list.PNG)
        
        We are now ready to play in our workspace.
        
        ## Conclusion
        
        In this article, we deployed Databricks notebook and library using Azure DevOps to manage a Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery pipeline. We saw that Azure Databricks is tightly integrated with other Microsoft Azure resources and services such as Keyvault, Storage Account and Azure Active Directory. For more complex workload you could consider integrating ETL tools like Azure Data Factory and its built-in linked service.
